**ERC20**
The ERC20 token is the most widely known and used. ERC20 is the technical standard that's used for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain to implement tokens. ERC20 has a simple interface for basic tokens.

You can keep track of fungible tokens by using ERC20 token contracts. Any one ERC20 token is equal to any other token. Also, ERC20 tokens don't have any associated special rights or behaviors, which make the tokens useful for things like staking, currency exchange, and voting rights.
